# Changelog
## 2.0 - 2023-07-11
* breaking: gaarf CLI tool supports multiple CIDs in `account` argument. 
`GoogleAdsApiClient` constructor and `loadAdsConfigFromFile` don't take customer_id anymore, 
but `GoogleAdsApiClient`'s methods `getCustomerIds`, `executeQuery` and `executeQueryStream` on the contrary now require a customer_id.
* Templates support (via https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
* AdsQueryExecutor: limit level of parallelism (be default there's a threshold to issue simultaneous parallel queries)
* CsvWriter: support `file-per-customer` argument - split output file by customer

## 1.15 - 2023-05-18
* added support for `date_iso` macro (compatible with the Python version)
* added global executable aliases `gaarf-node` and `gaarf-node-bq`

## 1.14 - 2023-04-26
* support Google Ads API v13 (updated google-ads-api to v13)

## 1.13 - 2023-04-17
* bq-writer: added `array-handling`, `array-separator` options - array can be represented either as arrays (default) or string (as in Python version)
* csv-writer: added `array-separator` option + similar object to bq-writer for array representation (previously JSON.stringify used)

## 1.12 - 2023-03-31
* Added `disable-account-expansion` flag to disable MCC account expansion into child accounts (useful when you need to execute a query at MCC level)
* (released as 1.11.9) enhanced logging support for running in Google Cloud (while running as part Gaarf Workflow all log entries have trace id from the root request)

## 1.11 - 2023-02-11

## 1.9.0 - 2022-11-21

## 1.7.0 - 2022-09-09
* BigQueryWrite: changed data load method (loadTable instead of insertAll), which results in a significant speed up

* all console output replaced with logging, setting log-level via cli args

## 1.4.0 - 2022-07-22
